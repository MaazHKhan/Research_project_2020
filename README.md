Research Project: Implementation of sigmoid activation function for neural networks on a field programmable gate array device (FPGA).
University of Pretoria (Jun 2020 - Nov 2020 )
Functional implementation of a Sigmoid activation function on a cyclone V FPGA using the VHDL language. Sigmoid activation functions are used in feed forward neural networks. The sigmoid function is monotonic growing and differentiable. The aim of this project was to achieve an absolute error rate below 10% and a mean error rate below 5%. The project was successfully deployed with an absolute error rate of 3.79% and a mean error rate of 0.441%. However, the trade-off of the system is an increase in execution time from 41.94308µs to 78.89604µs.
